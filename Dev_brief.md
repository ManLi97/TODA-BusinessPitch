# TODA Investor Pitch - Dev Brief

## Tech Stack (Fixed)
- **Deployment:** GitHub → Netlify
- **Type:** Static website (no backend required)

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation & Structure
**Objective:** Create the technical foundation with 8 distinct sections and placeholder content.

**Your Responsibilities (Coding AI):**
- Design decisions (color scheme, typography, layout, spacing)
- Section structure and visual hierarchy
- Smooth scroll implementation between sections
- Responsive design for tablet and laptop viewing
- Overall visual identity and professional appearance

**Deliverable:** A complete scrollable website with 8 sections containing placeholder content that demonstrates the intended structure and design.

### Phase 2: Iterative Content Integration
**Objective:** Replace placeholder content section by section with real content.

**Process:**
- Each section will be completed individually
- Content will be provided incrementally by the founding team
- Manuel acts as the interface between content creation and technical implementation

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Seamless navigation between the 8 sections
- **Responsive Design:** Must work flawlessly on laptops and tablets (event/presentation context)
- **Performance:** Fast loading times - presentation context requires instant readiness

### Content Type Support
The structure must accommodate:
- **Text & Headlines:** Various hierarchy levels, long-form and short-form text
- **Images/Graphics:** Product screenshots, team photos, visual assets
- **Charts/Graphs:** Data visualization for market analysis section
- **Mixed Content:** Sections combining multiple content types

### Section Requirements
Each of the 8 sections needs to:
- Be visually distinct but cohesive with overall design
- Support different content densities (some text-heavy, some data-heavy)
- Work as standalone units while contributing to the narrative flow

Expected Layout Patterns
To ensure consistency and professional presentation structure, the following layout patterns should be implemented across sections:
Core Layout Components

Hero Sections: Full-width sections with large visuals and centered/overlaid text for maximum impact
Split Layouts: Side-by-side arrangements of text and images (alternating left/right for visual rhythm)
Multi-Column Grids: 2-3 column layouts for presenting statistics, facts, or feature comparisons
Icon-Card Components: Card-based layouts with icons/badges and descriptive content (suitable for features, benefits, or processes)
Image Galleries/Grids: Grid-based image presentations for showcasing products, team members, or visual assets

Layout Flexibility
These patterns provide structural guidance, but you have complete freedom in:

How you combine and adapt these patterns within sections
The specific implementation and proportions
Responsive behavior and breakpoints
Visual hierarchy within each pattern

## Design Freedom
You (Coding AI) have full creative control over:
- Visual design language
- Color palette
- Typography choices
- Layout patterns
- Spacing and rhythm
- Interactive elements (hover states, transitions)
- Section transitions and animations

**Guideline:** Create a professional, modern presentation that feels appropriate for investor pitches while being visually engaging.

## Non-Requirements (Phase 1)
The following features are NOT needed in the initial build:
- Progress indicator
- Navigation menu
- Print/PDF export functionality
- Video embedding
- Backend functionality
- User authentication
- Analytics/tracking
- Lead capture forms

## Context for Design Decisions
- **Audience:** Investors, Business Angels, Industry Insiders
- **Presentation Context:** Professional pitch scenarios, both 1-on-1 and at events
- **Content Flow:** Emotional → Rational → Visionary (design should support this arc)
- **Goal:** Make investors want to schedule a follow-up meeting


## Development Note
This is a presentation tool, not a marketing website. The focus is on clear information delivery with professional polish, not on conversion optimization or user engagement metrics.
